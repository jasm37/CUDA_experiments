Exercise 7
The code is in str_tensor/main.cu
To run the code set the parameters -sigma(float) and -scale(float). These are the std dev of the kernel and the scale factor to display the matrix M(coeff) respectively. For example:

	./main -i ../../images/owl.png -sigma 0.3 -scale 10

1. 2. 3. 4. The code starts in line 278 and the questions start from line 350

Remarks: The code sde shows coefficients m_11, m_12 and m_22 of the matrix M.
